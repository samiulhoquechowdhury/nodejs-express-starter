/**
 * Discuss error handling in asynchronous JavaScript code. How can errors be propagated and handled in callback-based code, Promises, and async/await? Provide examples for each approach.
In callback-based code, errors are typically passed as the first argument to the callback function. In Promises, errors are handled using the .catch() method. With async/await, errors are caught using try/catch blocks. Examples for each approach were provided in previous answers.

What are the common pitfalls to avoid when working with asynchronous code in JavaScript/Node.js? Provide examples and explanations of how to address these pitfalls.
Common pitfalls include not handling errors properly, forgetting to return Promises from functions, and relying too much on nested callbacks. To address these pitfalls, ensure proper error handling, always return Promises from functions that perform asynchronous operations, and use techniques like Promises or async/await to flatten callback chains.

Explain the concept of event loop in Node.js and how it enables asynchronous programming. How does it differ from traditional multi-threaded approaches to concurrency?
The event loop is the mechanism that allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations by handling asynchronous tasks in a single-threaded event-driven environment. Unlike traditional multi-threaded approaches, where each task might have its own thread, Node.js uses a single thread to handle all tasks, making it more memory-efficient and scalable for I/O-bound applications.

Describe scenarios where asynchronous programming is particularly beneficial in web development. Provide examples of real-world use cases where asynchronous code is essential for performance and scalability.
Asynchronous programming is beneficial in scenarios where web servers need to handle concurrent requests efficiently without blocking the main thread. Examples include handling multiple database queries simultaneously, serving static files while waiting for database responses, and making API requests to external services without delaying other operations. Asynchronous code ensures that the server remains responsive and can handle high loads effectively.
