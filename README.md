# Learning Node.js and Express.js

Welcome to my repository where I'm documenting my journey of learning Node.js and Express.js!

## Introduction

This repository serves as a learning playground for exploring backend development using Node.js and Express.js. As a beginner, I'm excited to dive into the world of server-side JavaScript and build robust web applications.

## Goals

- Gain a solid understanding of Node.js fundamentals.
- Learn how to use Express.js to create efficient and scalable web servers.
- Implement RESTful APIs and handle HTTP requests/responses.
- Explore middleware, routing, and error handling in Express.js.
- Integrate databases (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) with Node.js and Express.js.
- Practice best practices in backend development, including security measures and performance optimization.

## Contents

1. **Code Samples**: Contains code snippets and small projects demonstrating various concepts in Node.js and Express.js.
2. **Tutorials**: Links to helpful tutorials, articles, and resources that I find useful during my learning journey.
3. **Documentation**: Personal notes, summaries, and documentation created as I progress through learning.

## Getting Started

```

const http = require('http')

const hostname = '127.0.0.1'
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('content-Text', 'text/plain');

    res.end('Server is running..');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```
`javascript`
